## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

DHIS2 (District Health Information System v2) is widely used for collecting, analyzing and using health data. However, in many regions connectivity is intermittent or unreliable.  
**OfflineAppDHIS2** provides offline support so users can still access cached data and continue limited operations without an internet connection. Once the connection is restored, cached data can be synced back to DHIS2.
